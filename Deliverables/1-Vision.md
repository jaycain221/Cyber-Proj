# CSCI 402 – Cyber Security Principles – Final Project

## Overview
Welcome to our Keylogger project for Group 4! This project involves the development of a Python script designed to capture and log keyboard input events. The script operates discreetly in the background, capturing key presses and storing them in a specified text file. This project is intended for educational purposes only, and it is crucial to use it responsibly and ethically.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

**Keylogging:** Implement a keylogging functionality that captures various keyboard events, including standard keys like letters and special keys like 'space', 'enter', and 'backspace.'

**Logging to File:** Log the captured keyboard events to a text file, providing a record of the user's key presses over time.

**Background Operation:** Ensure the script operates in the background without displaying a console window, creating a discreet logging process.

**Responsibility:** Emphasize the importance of ethical use, user consent, and legal compliance when working with keylogging functionality.

---

## Project Components

The project consists of the following components:

- **`keylogger.py`:** The main Python script containing the keylogging functionality.
- **`output.txt`:** The text file where the captured keyboard events are logged.

---

## Risks

Consider the following risks associated with the project:

1. **Security Risks:** Keyloggers, if misused, can pose security risks and may be considered malicious software. Ensure ethical use and respect user privacy.

2. **Legal Compliance:** Keylogging functionality may be subject to legal restrictions. Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.

3. **User Consent:** Always obtain explicit consent before running any keylogging functionality.

---

## Next Steps

After completing the initial setup, consider the following next steps:

1. **Customization:** Customize the script or explore additional features based on your learning goals.

2. **Documentation:** Document any modifications, features, or improvements made to the script.

3. **Ethical Considerations:** Continue emphasizing ethical considerations, user privacy, and legal compliance throughout the project.

4. **Feedback:** Gather feedback from team members and stakeholders to refine the project further.

Remember to prioritize ethical considerations, user privacy, and legal compliance in all your projects.
